## Key notes on badge_component.html
- \<input...\> defines an HTML5 input element.
- The (input)="updateBadge(...)" text creates an event binding.
- The target of the event appears to the left of the equals sign in parentheses, (input). This event binding listens for an input event on the input field.
- The template statement, updateBadge($event.target.value), appears (in quotes) to the right of the equals sign.
- This template statement calls a method called updateBadge() that you’ll define soon in Dart code. The argument is the value that the user entered.
- As you can see, a template statement can use functions and variables defined in a component’s Dart code.
- The event object, $event, contains the value of the raised event. In this example, the event object represents the DOM event object, so the new value resides in $event.target.value.
- The template statement executes whenever an input event occurs on this element.
- By convention, a template statement is short—more complex logic should be placed in a function and called from the template statement.
- The maxLength="15" text limits user input to 15 characters.
