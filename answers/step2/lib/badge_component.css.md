## Key notes from badge_component.css
- Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language used for describing the appearance of a document written in HTML, XHTML, or other markup languages.
- Each component should have a style sheet that describes the appearance for that component.
- Naming the CSS file with the same prefix used for the component is an Angular convention.
- Next, youâ€™ll connect the style sheet to the component in the Dart code.
