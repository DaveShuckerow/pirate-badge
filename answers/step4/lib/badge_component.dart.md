## Key notes from badge_component.dart
- All instance variables defined in an Angular component are visible to the template for that component.
- As you’ve seen, the HTML template uses isButtonEnabled when determining whether to display the button.
- Clicking the button displays “Davy Jones” on the pirate badge. In Step 5, you replace this with more interesting logic.
- Enable the button if the input field is empty, otherwise disable it.
- The text on the button also changes depending on whether it’s enabled.
