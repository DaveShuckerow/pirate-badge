# Darrrt
Pirate badge app written with Angular Dart.

Walking through an introduction codelab to development with Angular and Dart.

# Guide
## Step 0
You'll need the following tools to build this codelab on your own:
 - [Dart SDK](https://www.dartlang.org/install)
 - A code editor
   - I recommend [Atom](https://atom.io) and the Atom dart plugin
   - IntelliJ Idea also has a very good Dart plugin that you install.

## Step 1
We'll start by running the following commands:

`pub get`

This will get all of the dependencies that this code will need to run in your
browser.

Now run

`pub serve`

This will compile your app to javascript and run it at http://localhost:8080
